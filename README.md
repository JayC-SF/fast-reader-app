420-320-DW JavaScript - Project 2 Speed Reader
Created by Kristina Amend & Juan-Carlos Sreng-Flores

A simple implementation of a speed reader that display quotes from popular Parks & Recreation character Ron Swanson.

The user can select the words per minute (defaults at 100) and select START/STOP to get the next quote. 
Quotes are fetched randomly from an API that returns a single JSON. 
Quotes are displayed one word at a time, with each focus letter in red (which is dependant on the words length).

More about speed reading: Displaying the words at a variable speed and fixating on a specific character triggers the brain to recognize that word quickly. This eliminates internally speaking the words and not having to move our eyes as we read, therefore increasing one's ability to speed read!
